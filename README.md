Mixed set of utility functions in octave/matlab
Currently has
  readfromCSV() - Utility to read and parse a .csv file from disk. Unlike
    the built-in functions, this one has ability to parse both the row and
    column headers at a specified row and column(yet to be fully implemented)
  indexof() - Searches a string in a cell array and returns the index. Also
    can search an entire list of strings in a cell array and return corresponding
    indices as a vector.
  sak_normalise() - Swiss Army Knife for data normalisation. Support multiple
    methods for data normalisation. Function implementation is pretty self
    explanatory.
